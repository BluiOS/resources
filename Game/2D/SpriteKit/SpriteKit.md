## What is SpriteKit?

based on apple's website:<br/>
SpriteKit is a tool for making 2D games. It helps games run well and not use up too much battery. You can make cool effects and animations, like making things move around or look different. It also works with other tools like SceneKit, which helps make 3D stuff, and lets you do things like make objects bump into each other or change how light looks in your game.
